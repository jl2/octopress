I've decided to start using GitHub Pages to start blogging about code related activities.  I've been terrible at updating my blog at [jlarocco.com](http://jlarocco.com), and I'm hoping that creating a new page will be enough to motivate me to post more.

Lately I've been learning and using Common Lisp for a lot of projects, so there should be a lot of posts here about that.
